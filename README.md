#  STUDENTS ATTENDANCE MONITORING SYSTEM USING FACIAL RECOGNITION

# INTRODUCTION
  -  Face recognition is one of the most successful application of image analysis and it recently gained a significant attention.
  - Systems have been developed for face detection and tracking are still offers a great challenge to computer vision and pattern recognition researchers.
  - Recognising face is natural process where people usually do it without having much conscious but while applying this in area of computer vision remains difficult problem.
  - By accepting above challenges ,we are in the process of developing real time face detection and recognition.

# REQUIREMENTS
- 4 GB RAM (min)
- 250 GB Storage
- 2.5 GHZ processor
- Python 2.7 and newer
- Haar Cascade Frontal face classifiers
- Webcam or USB camera
- MySQL Database

# PROPOSED METHODOLOGY
 - The proposed methodology uses several  technique for the feature extraction of the face from the camera.
 - The openCV is used as the library function to carry out the image processing.
 - The database used for storing the attendance is MySQL.
 - Local Binary Patterns Histograms is used as the face recognition algorithm along with haarcascade classifier.

# OPENCV

 - OpenCV is a Library which is used to carry out image processing using programming languages like python. This project utilizes OpenCV Library to make a Real-Time Face Detection using your webcam as a primary camera.

# MySQL
 - MySQL can run on multiple platforms such as Linux, Windows, Unix, and an information schema to define and manage your metadata. You can either install it on your local system or even on the server as well. It is a really flexible, scalable, fast, and reliable solution.

# LBPH (Local Binary Patterns Histograms) Algorithm
- The Local Binary Pattern Histogram(LBPH) algorithm is a simple solution on face recognition problem, which can recognize both front face and side face.

# HAAR CASCADE CLASSIFIER
- Haar Cascade classifier is based on the Haar Wavelet technique to analyse pixels in the image into squares by function. Haar cascade classifier is based on Viola Jones detection algorithm which is trained in given some input faces and non-faces and training a classifier which identifies a face.
